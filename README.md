## Team Members:
DeAndrea Norris | Beth Kaster

## Data Sources:
* https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants
* https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data

## ETL Plan:
* The data sources are in CSV form. We will use Jupyter Notebook to <b>extract</b> the files.
* We will <b>transform</b> the data using Jupyter Notebooks to clean, select, join, filter, and aggregate.
* We will <b>load</b> the clean data into the Postgress SQL database.


## Short Description:
Using these two data sources, a user could use the information presented to ask questions or anaylze trends such as:
* Which city has the most (or least) fast food restaurants per capita?
* Are there any trends of fast food restaurant preferences by ethnicity?
* What are the preferred fast food restaurant names per state or city?
